/**
 * Objective: Given an array of integers of size N, print all the subsets of size k. (k<=N)
 * Example:
 * Generate all subsets of a fixed size k of a given set [1,2,3â€¦n]. e.g, if n=5 and k=3, the output will look like
    1 2 3     1 2 4     1 2 5
    1 3 4     1 3 5     1 4 5
    2 3 4     2 3 5     2 4 5
    3 4 5
 *    
 * Solution:
 * 1.Create an boolean array of the same size as the given array.
 * Now for every integer we have two options, whether to select it or ignore it.
 * Now if we select it, we will put TRUE in the boolean array at the corresponding index or if we ignore it, put FALSE at that index.
 * We will start with currentLength =0 and do the recursive calls for both the options mentioned in the previous step.
 * If we select an integer to print, make currentLength +1 and if we ignore, dont change currentLength.
 * Another important factor is from which index you will start making the subset of size k. Initialize start = 0, and with every 
 * recursive call, make start + 1 ( for both the scenarios mentioned in the steps above).
 * Print the elements when currentLength = k.
