/**
 * Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once 
 * and return the new length.
 * Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.
 * For example,
 * Given input array nums = [1,1,2],
 * Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 
 * respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
 * 
 * Algorithm
 * Since the array is already sorted, we can keep two pointers i and j, where i is the slow-runner while 
 * j is the fast-runner. As long as nums[i] = nums[j], we increment j to skip the duplicate.
 * 
 * When we encounter nums[j] â‰  nums[i], the duplicate run has ended so we must copy its 
 * value to nums[i + 1]. i is then incremented and we repeat the same process again until j
 * reaches the end of array.
 * 
 * Complexity analysis
 * Time complextiy : O(n). Assume that n is the length of array. Each of i and j traverses at most n steps.
 * Space complexity : O(1).
