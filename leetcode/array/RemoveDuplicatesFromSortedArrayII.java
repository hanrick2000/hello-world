/**
 * Follow up for "Remove Duplicates":
 * What if duplicates are allowed at most twice?
 * For example,
 * Given sorted array nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],
 * Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 
 * 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

/**
 * Question wants us to return the length of new array after removing duplicates and that 
 * we don't care about what we leave beyond new length , hence we can use i to keep track 
 * of the position and update the array.
