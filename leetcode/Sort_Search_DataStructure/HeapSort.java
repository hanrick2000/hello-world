 * 
 * Definition. 
 * A binary heap is a set of nodes with keys arranged in a complete heap-ordered binary tree, 
 * represented in level order in an array (not using the first entry).
 * Heap representations
 * In a heap, the parent of the node in position k is in position k/2; and, conversely, the two children 
 * of the node in position k are in positions 2k and 2k + 1. We can travel up and down by doing simple 
 * arithmetic on array indices: to move up the tree from a[k] we set k to k/2; to move down the tree we 
 * set k to 2*k or 2*k+1.
 * The structure we are using in this solution (Start at array position 1, ignore position 0) match this representation
 * e.g
 * 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
 *   X 
 *     T S 
 *         P L R A 
 *                  M O E E
 * 
 * X is parent of T, S
 * T is parent of P, L  |  S is parent of R, A
 * P is parent of M, O  |  L is parent of E, E
 * 
 * Heapsort. 
 * We can use any priority queue to develop a sorting method. We insert all the keys to be sorted 
 * into a minimum-oriented priority queue, then repeatedly use remove the minimum to remove them all in order. 
 * When using a heap for the priority queue, we obtain heapsort.
 * Focusing on the task of sorting, we abandon the notion of hiding the heap representation of the priority 
 * queue and use swim() and sink() directly. Doing so allows us to sort an array without needing any extra 
 * space, by maintaining the heap within the array to be sorted. Heapsort breaks into two phases: heap construction, 
 * where we reorganize the original array into a heap, and the sortdown, where we pull the items out of the heap 
 * in decreasing order to build the sorted result.
 * 
 * Heap construction. 
 * We can accomplish this task in time proportional to N lg N, by proceeding from left to 
 * right through the array, using swim() to ensure that the entries to the left of the scanning pointer make 
 * up a heap-ordered complete tree, like successive priority queue insertions. A clever method that is much 
 * more efficient is to proceed from right to left, using sink() to make subheaps as we go. Every position 
 * in the array is the root of a small subheap; sink() works or such subheaps, as well. If the two children 
 * of a node are heaps, then calling sink() on that node makes the subtree rooted there a heap.
 * 
 * Sortdown. 
 * Most of the work during heapsort is done during the second phase, where we remove the largest remaining 
 * items from the heap and put it into the array position vacated as the heap shrinks.
