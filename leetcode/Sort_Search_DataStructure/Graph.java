/**
 *  The {@code Graph} class represents an undirected graph of vertices
 *  named 0 through <em>V</em> - 1.
 *  It supports the following two primary operations: add an edge to the graph,
 *  iterate over all of the vertices adjacent to a vertex. It also provides
 *  methods for returning the number of vertices <em>V</em> and the number
 *  of edges <em>E</em>. Parallel edges and self-loops are permitted.
 *  By convention, a self-loop <em>v</em>-<em>v</em> appears in the
 *  adjacency list of <em>v</em> twice and contributes two to the degree
 *  of <em>v</em>.
 *  <p>
 *  This implementation uses an adjacency-lists representation, which 
 *  is a vertex-indexed array of {@link Bag} objects.
 *  All operations take constant time (in the worst case) except
 *  iterating over the vertices adjacent to a given vertex, which takes
 *  time proportional to the number of such vertices.
 *  <p>
