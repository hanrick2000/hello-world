 Given a string representing arbitrarily nested ternary expressions, calculate the result of the expression. 
 You can always assume that the given expression is valid and only consists of digits 0-9, ?, :, T and F 
 (T and F represent True and False respectively).
 
Note:
The length of the given string is â‰¤ 10000.
Each number will contain only one digit.
The conditional expressions group right-to-left (as usual in most languages).
The condition will always be either T or F. That is, the condition will never be a digit.
The result of the expression will always evaluate to either a digit 0-9, T or F.

Example 1:
Input: "T?2:3"
Output: "2"
Explanation: If true, then result is 2; otherwise result is 3.

Example 2:
Input: "F?1:T?4:5"
Output: "4"
Explanation: The conditional expressions group right-to-left. Using parenthesis, it is read/evaluated as:

             "(F ? 1 : (T ? 4 : 5))"                   "(F ? 1 : (T ? 4 : 5))"
          -> "(F ? 1 : 4)"                 or       -> "(T ? 4 : 5)"
          -> "4"                                    -> "4"

Example 3:
Input: "T?T?F:5:3"
Output: "F"
Explanation: The conditional expressions group right-to-left. Using parenthesis, it is read/evaluated as:

             "(T ? (T ? F : 5) : 3)"                   "(T ? (T ? F : 5) : 3)"
          -> "(T ? F : 3)"                 or       -> "(T ? F : 5)"
          -> "F"                                    -> "F"

/**
 Solution:
We push each character of the expression into a stack reversely.
If the last character in the stack is ''?", it means the answer to evaluate the current character is in the stack.
We pop up the two potential answer and evaluate it.
After that, we push back the answer.
If the last character in the stack is not "?", we push the current character into the stack.
Finally, the answer is the last element left in the stack.
