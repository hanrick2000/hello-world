 * Refer to
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-string-from-binary-tree/#/description
 * You need to construct a string consists of parenthesis and integers from a binary 
 * tree with the preorder traversing way.
 * The null node needs to be represented by empty parenthesis pair "()". And you need 
 * to omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that don't affect the one-to-one mapping 
 * relationship between the string and the original binary tree.

	Example 1:
	
	Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,4]
	       1
	     /   \
	    2     3
	   /    
	  4     
	
	Output: "1(2(4))(3)"
	
	Explanation: Originallay it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", 
	but you need to omit all the unnecessary empty parenthesis pairs. 
	And it will be "1(2(4))(3)".

    Example 2:

	Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,null,4]
	       1
	     /   \
	    2     3
	     \  
	      4 
	
	Output: "1(2()(4))(3)"
	
	Explanation: Almost the same as the first example, 
	except we can't omit the first parenthesis pair to break the one-to-one 
	mapping relationship between the input and the output

 * Solution 1: Approach #1 Using Recursion [Accepted]
 * https://leetcode.com/articles/construct-string-from-binary-tree/
 * This solution is very simple. We simply need to do the preorder traversal of the given Binary Tree. 
 * But, along with this, we need to make use of braces at appropriate positions. But, we also need to 
 * make sure that we omit the unnecessary braces. To do the preorder traversal, we make use of recursion. 
 * We print the current node and call the same given function for the left and the right children of the 
 * node in that order(if they exist). For every node encountered, the following cases are possible.
 * 
 * Case 1: Both the left child and the right child exist for the current node. In this case, we need to 
 * put the braces () around both the left child's preorder traversal output and the right child's 
 * preorder traversal output.
 * 
 * Case 2: None of the left or the right child exist for the current node. In this case, as shown in 
 * the figure below, considering empty braces for the null left and right children is redundant. 
 * Hence, we need not put braces for any of them.
 *                   1
 *                  / \
 *                 2   3
 *                / \   
 *               4   5
 * output: 1(2(4)(5))(3()())
 * refine: 1(2(4)(5))(3)
 *                   
 * Case 3: Only the left child exists for the current node. As the figure below shows, putting empty 
 * braces for the right child in this case is unnecessary while considering the preorder traversal. 
 * This is because the right child will always come after the left child in the preorder traversal. 
 * Thus, omitting the empty braces for the right child also leads to same mapping between the string 
 * and the binary tree.                        
 *                   1
 *                  / \
 *                 2   3
 *                /   / \   
 *               4   5   6
 * output: 1(2(4)())(3(5)(6))
 * refine: 1(2(4))(3(5)(6))
 * 
 * Case 4: Only the right child exists for the current node. In this case, we need to consider the 
 * empty braces for the left child. This is because, during the preorder traversal, the left child needs 
 * to be considered first. Thus, to indicate that the child following the current node is a right child 
 * we need to put a pair of empty braces for the left child. 
 *                     1
 *                  /    \
 *                 2      3
 *                  \    / \   
 *                   4  5   6
 * output: 1(2()(4))(3(5)(6))
 * refine: cannot remove the () before (4)
 * 
 * Just by taking care of the cases, mentioned above, we can obtain the required output string.
 * 
 * Complexity Analysis
    Time complexity : O(n). The preorder traversal is done over the n nodes of the given Binary Tree.
    Space complexity : O(n). The depth of the recursion tree can go upto n in case of a skewed tree.
 * 
 * Solution 2: Approach #2 Iterative Method Using stack [Accepted]
 * https://leetcode.com/articles/construct-string-from-binary-tree/
 * In order to solve the given problem, we can also make use of a stack. To see how to do it, 
 * we'll go through the implementation and we'll also look at the idea behind each step.
 * We make use of a stack onto which various nodes of the given tree will be pushed during the process. 
 * The node at the top of the stack represents the current node to be processed. Whenever a node 
 * has been processed once, it is marked as visited. The reasoning behind this will be discussed soon.
 * We start off by pushing the root of the binary tree onto the stack. Now, the root acts as the 
 * current node. For every current node encountered, firstly, we check if it has not been visited already. 
 * If not, we add it to the set of visited nodes. Since, for the preorder traversal, we know, we need to 
 * process the nodes in the order current-left-right. Thus, we add a ( followed by the current node to the 
 * string s to be returned. Now, if both the left and the right children of the current node exist, we 
 * need to process them in the order left-right. To do so, we need to push them onto the stacks in the 
 * reverse order, so that when they are picked up later on, their order of processing gets corrected.
 * Since we've already added (current_node(current\_node(current_node to the string s, if only the right 
 * child of the current node exists, as discussed in case 4 in the last approach, we need to put a () in
 *  s representing the null left node. We need not push anything onto the stack for the left node and we 
 *  can directly add the () to s for this. But, we still need to push the right child onto the stack for 
 *  future processing.
 *  If only the left child exists, we need not consider the right child at all, as discussed in case 3 
 *  in the last approach. We can continue the process by just pushing the left child onto the stack.
 *  Now, we need to note that even when a node is being processed, if it has not already been visited, 
 *  it isn't popped off from the stack. But, if a node that has already been processed(i.e. its children 
 *  have been considered already), it is popped off from the stack when encountered again. Such a situation 
 *  will occur for a node only when the preorder traversal of both its left and right sub-trees has been 
 *  completely done. Thus, we need to add a ) to mark the end of the preorder traversal of the current 
 *  node as well.
 *  Thus, at the end, we get the required pre-order traversal in the substring s(1:nâˆ’1). Here, n represents 
 *  the length of s. This is because, we need not put the parentheses(redundant) at the outermost level.
 *  
 *  Complexity Analysis
    Time complexity : O(n). n nodes are pushed and popped in a stack.
    Space complexity : O(n). stack size can grow upto n.
