 Partition a set into two subsets such that the difference of subset sums is minimum
 Given a set of integers, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that 
 the absolute difference between their sums is minimum.
 If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m elements, Subset2 
 must have n-m elements and the value of abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.

 Example:
 Input:  arr[] = {1, 6, 11, 5} 
 Output: 1
 Explanation:
 Subset1 = {1, 5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 12 
 Subset2 = {11}, sum of Subset2 = 11
