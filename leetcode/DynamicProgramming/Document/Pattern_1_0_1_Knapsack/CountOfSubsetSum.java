 Combination Sum IV
 This Combination Sum question a little different than I, II, III, since it only requires counting the numbers of result,
 not like I, II, III must use backtracking DFS to getting combination sets, so we can use DP (top down and bottom up) here
 Refer to
 https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iv/
 Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations 
 that add up to a positive integer target.

Example:

nums = [1, 2, 3]
target = 4

The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)

Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
Therefore the output is 7.
