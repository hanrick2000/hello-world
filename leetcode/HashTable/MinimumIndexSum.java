 * Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have 
 * a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.
 * You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index sum. 
 * If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. 
 * You could assume there always exists an answer.
    Example 1:
    Input:
    ["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
    ["Piatti", "The Grill at Torrey Pines", "Hungry Hunter Steakhouse", "Shogun"]
    Output: ["Shogun"]
    Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".

    Example 2:
    Input:
    ["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
    ["KFC", "Shogun", "Burger King"]
    Output: ["Shogun"]
    Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).

 * Note:
    The length of both lists will be in the range of [1, 1000].
    The length of strings in both lists will be in the range of [1, 30].
    The index is starting from 0 to the list length minus 1.
    No duplicates in both lists.

 * Solution
 * https://leetcode.com/articles/minimum-index-sum-of-two-lists/
 * Approach #3 Using HashMap (linear) [Accepted]
 * We make use of a HashMap to solve the given problem in a different way in this approach. 
 * Firstly, we traverse over the whole list1 and create an entry for each element 
 * of list1 in a HashMap map, of the form (list[i],i). 
 * Here, iii refers to the index of the ith element, and list[i] is the ith element itself. 
 * Thus, we create a mapping from the elements of list1 to their indices.
 * Now, we traverse over list2. For every element ,list2[j], of list2 encountered, we check 
 * if the same element already exists as a key in the map. If so, it means that the element 
 * exists in both list1list1list1 and list2list2list2. Thus, we find out the sum of indices 
 * corresponding to this element in the two lists, given by sum=map.get(list[j])+jsum = 
 * map.get(list[j]) + jsum=map.get(list[j])+j. If this sum is lesser than the minimum 
 * sum obtained till now, we update the resultant list to be returned, resresres, with the 
 * ement list2[j] as the only entry in it.
 * If the sum is equal to the minimum sum obtained till now, we put an extra entry corresponding 
 * to the element list2[j] in the resresres list.
 * Complexity Analysis
 *
 * Time complexity : O(l1+l2). Every item of list2 is checked in a map of list1. l1 and l2
 * are the lengths of list1 and list2 respectively.
 * Space complexity : O(l1âˆ—x). hashmap size grows upto l1, where x refers to average string length.
